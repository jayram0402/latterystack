# LotteryStack:

LotteryStack is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to participate in a lottery using the solidity smart contract.

## How it Works

- Users can purchase tickets for the lottery using Ethereum (ETH).
- Each ticket purchase adds the user's address to the list of participants.
- At predefined intervals or when a certain number of tickets have been sold, a winner is randomly selected.
- The winner receives the entire pot, which consists of the total amount of ETH collected from ticket sales.
- The process is transparent, secure, and verifiable on the blockchain.

## Features

- Secure and transparent lottery system based on Ethereum blockchain and Solidity smart contracts.
- Random selection of winners using cryptographic techniques to ensure fairness.
- Automatic distribution of winnings to the winning participant's Ethereum address.
- Option for users to verify the fairness of the lottery by inspecting the smart contract code and transaction history on the blockchain.

## Technologies Used

- Ethereum Blockchain
- Solidity Smart Contracts

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install MetaMask or any Ethereum wallet extension in your browser.
3. Deploy the smart contract to an Ethereum testnet or a local blockchain network like Ganache.
4. Interact with the dApp through the web interface or using web3.js to purchase tickets and participate in the lottery.
